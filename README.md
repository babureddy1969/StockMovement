# StockMovement
Determines the stock movement over the last one year and estimates how long one has to wait see positive stock price change.

One year historical data for all stocks from nse were processed to find how often the stock price went up from its previous high. The results were saved in separate files. The sorted output was stored in result.csv file. Surprisingly I found that the TRENT stock wen up 88 times in one year, which is the maximum. I think more than 60 times increment in one year is a good sign for investment but it also requires additional market analysis.
